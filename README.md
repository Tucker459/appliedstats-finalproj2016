# Methods of Applied Statistics Final Project 2016

This project was taken in [Methods of Applied Statistics](https://www.coursera.org/learn/stat-420/) course which is apart of UofI [Master in Computer Science](https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/graduate/professional-mcs-program/mcs-data-science-track) Program during Fall 2016. The objective of the project was to answer a question that we set forth while utilizing the skills learned from this statistics course. Such as, model building, model diagnostics, simple/multiple linear regression, feature engineering, variance stabilization, transformation, goodness-of-fit vs model complexity, etc. This project was completed by [Eric Perales](https://github.com/omarterp/), Faisal Hoda, and myself. 

Conveniently, Yelp was hosting their 8th annual [Yelp Dataset Challenge](https://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge). This allowed us to utilize their massive datasets to answer some questions. We decided to explore the relationship between the number of fans associated with a given user and how this is impacted by the user's other attributes. What drives yelping fans? Is it focusing on a small niches of business and restaurants, the amount of cool_votes a person, the popularity of the businesses and restaurants? These are the type of solutions we were focused on answering while doing this project.
